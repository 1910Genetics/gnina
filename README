gnina is not smina/vina

gnina (pronounced NEE-na) is a fork of smina, which is a fork of AutoDock Vina.

gnina will contain highly experimental code with substantial algorithmic
and implementation differences from smina/vina.

At this stage of development, you should not use this code - use smina (http://smina.sf.net/).
